# Available actions 
The plugin includes 6 actions (each can be dragged from the Stream Deck app on to an key). Here is a more in depth description of each action: 

## Super Macro
This is the basic implementation. Create a macro and run it on keypress. Examples can be seen in the Usage Examples section.

## Super Macro Toggle
Toggle between two different macros on the same key.

## Sticky Super Macro
Click once to enable, the macro will run again and again until either the button is pressed again OR until the loop ends.

## Keystroke PTT
This action limits the action to either one command (such as {{ctrl}{c}}) or one character. The command will be run again and again as long as you continue to press the key.

## Sticky Keystroke
This action limits the action to either one command (such as {{ctrl}{c}}) or one character. The command will be run again and again until the button is pressed again OR until the Loop ends.

## Mouse Location
!!! "Long pressing button"

    **Note:** Long pressing the button on the Stream Deck will copy the current X,Y shown on the key to your Clipboard.
Consider this more of a helper action, it shows you the current position of your mouse cursor. You can use it to determine where you want SuperMacro to move your mouse (Using the {{MOUSEXY}} Mouse Command).
