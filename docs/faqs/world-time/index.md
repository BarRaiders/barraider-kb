!!! info "Why is the city name showing GMT-X instead of GMT+X and vice versa?"

    POSIX compatibility requires that the offsets are inverted. Therefore, Etc/GMT-X will have an offset of +X and Etc/GMT+X will have an offset of -X. Please proceed with the steps below to override the default city name.
