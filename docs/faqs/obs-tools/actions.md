I'm leaving most of this one for you, good sir!  I intended this to be "Features" with a slightly more Stream-Deck-y name. ;)
I also threw in the Instant Replay video here to try and consolidate things (and to demo how to add a YT video)

## Instant Replay
- Click to save the last seconds of your stream to your OBS “Recordings” folder.
- Long-Press the button to toggle whether the Instant Replay buffer is recording or not
